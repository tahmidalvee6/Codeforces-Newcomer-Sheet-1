 and B
. Print floor, ceil and round of A/B

Note:

Floor: Is a mathematical function that takes a real number X
 and its output is the greatest integer less than or equal to X
.
Ceil: Is a mathematical function that takes a real number X
 and its output is the smallest integer larger than or equal to X
.
Round: Is a mathematical function that takes a real number X
 and its output is the closest integer to that number X
.
